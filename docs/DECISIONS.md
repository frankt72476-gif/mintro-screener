# Decisions

Business rulings, dated, with the reasoning. Claude Code: treat these as binding. If a
decision looks wrong for what you're building, raise it — don't route around it.

## D-001 — Send is never blocked
**2026-08-20 · business owner**

IQwallet sees every report regardless of outcome. The Send button is always enabled. No
confirmation interstitial, no "are you sure", no supervisor override flow.

**Reasoning.** Mintro's role is triage and evidence, not gatekeeping. A tool that blocks a
send is making a determination, and we have been explicit throughout that determinations
are IQwallet's. Blocking would also create a record of Mintro deciding what IQwallet does
and does not get to see, which is exactly the wrong artifact to have in a dispute.

**Follow-on: the verdict banner is now descriptive, not directive.** It was "DO NOT
FORWARD". That was a recommendation, which contradicted the posture. It now states counts
and the most consequential failures as facts, with no instruction attached. Apply this to
all report copy — findings describe what was observed, never what should happen next.

An analyst may still choose to work with a merchant before sending. That's a workflow
decision they make outside the tool, not a state the tool enforces.

## D-002 — No scheduled re-scans in v1
**2026-08-20 · business owner**

Do not build a scheduler, a diff engine, or new-finding alerts. M6 in `CLAUDE.md` is
deferred, not cancelled.

**Reasoning.** The product is a pre-underwriting screen. Continuous monitoring is a
different product with a different buyer, and building it now would spread the team across
two problems before either works.

**What must still be true.** Re-running the same merchant is a normal operation and must
produce a **new immutable run**, never an update to an existing one:

- `runs` rows are append-only. Nothing in application code updates or deletes a completed run.
- Every run stamps `started_at`, `finished_at`, `ruleset_version`, and `mode`.
- Evidence keys are unique per run. A second scan never overwrites the first scan's
  screenshots — that would destroy the record of what the site looked like at the time.
- The merchant view lists runs in reverse chronological order. Comparison between runs is
  something a human does by reading two reports.

This costs nothing now and means adding scheduled re-scans later is a scheduler plus a
diff view, not a data migration.

## D-003 — Logo pending
**2026-08-20**

A replacement mark is coming from the business owner. Until it lands, `demo/index.html`
uses a CSS-drawn placeholder in the sidebar (`.brand-tile` / `.brand-word`).

When the file arrives: SVG preferred, single asset at `apps/web/src/assets/logo.svg`,
referenced from one place. Do not scatter the mark across components — the sidebar, the
PDF header, and the Resend email template all pull from the same source.

Needs to work in three contexts: on the deep violet sidebar, on white in the PDF header,
and at ~24px in the email. If the supplied mark only works on one of those, say so rather
than scaling it down and hoping.

## D-004 — The demo is not deployed
**2026-08-20 · business owner**

No Netlify site for `demo/index.html`. No Track A. Do not spend time on hosting it.

**What the demo is still for.** It stays in the repo as the **design specification for M3**.
The layout, the four-state system, the evidence slip, the tick strip, the filter behaviour
and the report copy are all settled and were reviewed. When building the React frontend,
port it faithfully rather than reinterpreting it — redesigning from scratch would repeat
work that is already done and would likely lose the parts that were deliberate (the
not-evaluable state, the descriptive-not-directive copy).

Open it locally in a browser when you need to see intended behaviour.

---

## D-005 — Infrastructure confirmed
**2026-08-20 · business owner**

Supabase and Fly.io are both already in use at Mintro. Fly is now the worker host; drop
Railway from consideration. Netlify remains the frontend host.

---

## D-006 — Playwright confirmed (architect's ruling)
**2026-08-20**

Playwright for the crawl worker. Full rationale in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Short version:
`storageState` is the authenticated-session handoff the whole gated-site design rests on,
tracing/HAR/screenshot are exactly our three evidence artifacts, and `page.pdf()` means the
report PDF needs no second rendering stack. Puppeteer, Selenium and fetch-based scraping
were each rejected for specific reasons — read them before proposing a swap.

---

## D-007 — Logo assets landed
**2026-08-20 · business owner supplied PNG**

Source is a 1024px PNG lockup: bright purple mark plus white wordmark on a deep violet
rounded tile, with the "i" dot in orange. Derived assets are in `brand/`.

    mintro-lockup-full.png   trimmed lockup, 985x704
    mintro-lockup-160/80/40  height-constrained exports
    mintro-mark-512/180/64   square app icon, glyph on a clean tile
    mintro-glyph.png         mark alone, alpha-masked, transparent background
    favicon-64 / favicon-32

**Known limitation, needs resolving.** The supplied file is raster, and the lockup's own
violet tile sits very close to the app sidebar violet — placed there it reads as a slightly
mismatched rectangle rather than a logo. Two consequences:

- On the **deep violet sidebar**, use `mintro-glyph.png` beside white wordmark text. Do not
  use the tiled lockup.
- On **white** (PDF header, Resend email), the tiled lockup is correct.

Ask the designer for the **SVG source**, ideally with a transparent-background variant and a
white knockout. Everything in `brand/` was extracted from a flattened raster and will not
scale cleanly past its exported sizes. This is a five-minute request to whoever made the
original and it removes a whole class of future asset problems.

## D-008 — The rule set is the source of truth for its own field names
**2026-08-20 · architect's ruling**

The tier field is named `tier` in `rules/ruleset.json`. `CLAUDE.md` hard constraint 4
previously called it `auto_tier`. There is no `auto_tier` field and there never was.
`CLAUDE.md` has been corrected.

**Reasoning.** Hard constraint 1 makes `rules/ruleset.json` the single source of truth. That
applies to the shape of the data, not only its contents. When prose and data disagree about
a field name, the data is right by definition and the prose is a bug — fix the prose.

**Follow-on: `categories[].prefix` added.** Rule IDs use a prefix that is not the category
id (`GATE`/`gate`, `DISC`/`disclose`, `CATG`/`catalog`, `FULF`/`fulfil`, `OFFS`/`offsite`,
`PAY`/`payment`, `COMM`/`comms`). That mapping was real but undeclared, which meant
validating it would have required hardcoding the table in the engine. It is now a `prefix`
field on each entry in the `categories` block, and the loader validates prefix-matches-
category from that data. The same rule applies to anything else the engine needs to know
about the rule set: declare it in the data, do not encode it in code.

## D-009 — State is determined by tier alone; severity is presentation
**2026-08-20 · business owner**

The four states are produced by exactly two inputs — whether the check observed a violation,
and the rule's `tier`.

    violation + tier auto_fail      -> fail
    violation + tier review_only    -> review
    no violation                    -> pass
    check could not run             -> not_evaluable

`sev` (`critical` / `major` / `minor`) **never affects state.** It drives ordering within the
report and nothing else. A `critical` rule with `tier: review_only` produces `review`, not
`fail`. Severity must never escalate a `review_only` finding to `fail` under any circumstance.

**Reasoning.** Severity says how much a finding matters if it is real. Tier says how confident
the check is that it is real. Collapsing the two lets a high-stakes-but-ambiguous check —
exactly the dosing and abbreviation cases hard constraint 4 exists to protect — auto-fail a
merchant on a guess. Those are the checks where false positives live, and a false `fail` on a
critical rule is the most expensive error the tool can make.

Note the fourth line: a check that could not run is `not_evaluable`, never `pass`. This
restates hard constraint 2 and is not negotiable.

## D-010 — Not used

Number reserved and skipped. The catalogue-scope decision below was drafted as D-010 before
the ruling assigned it D-011; the number is left unused rather than renumbering a decision
that may already have been cited.

## D-011 — Catalogue rules match product URLs, not every URL
**2026-08-20 · business owner**

CATG-001 through CATG-004 change from `scope: "all"` to `scope: "products"`.

**What prompted it.** The first Layer 0 run against five real storefronts auto-failed two
merchants on CATG-003 (No HCG or HGH, `critical`, `auto_fail`). Of the 27 matching URLs across
those two merchants, **none were product URLs** — every one was an editorial article:

    /ghrp-2-and-cjc-1295-blend-growth-hormone-deficiency-and-fat-metabolism/
    /sermorelin-ipamorelin-blend-potential-analogues-of-growth-hormone/

On biotechpeptides.com this is conclusive rather than inferred: its products sit under
`/product/`, 89 of them were classified as such, and none of the 21 matches was among them.

**Reasoning.** CATG-003 prohibits *selling* HCG/HGH. An article about growth-hormone research
is not an offer to sell. The matched strings are real, but the finding they generate —
"prohibited product", with a blog post as its evidence — is false, and a false finding of that
shape discredits the whole report.

The observation underlying those matches is not worthless; it is filed under the wrong rule.
Editorial content that reads as human-use promotion is a real signal, and the Layer 2 text
checks are where it belongs.

**Alternatives rejected.** Downgrading CATG-003 to `review_only` would suppress a *correct*
critical failure — swisschems.is `/product/hcg-5000-iu/` is HCG offered for sale — in order to
fix a miscategorised one. Teaching the engine to classify editorial content would put
rule-adjacent knowledge into code, which is what hard constraint 1 exists to prevent.

**The trade accepted.** A prohibited item listed somewhere other than a product URL is no
longer caught at Layer 0. That is the right trade: Layer 2 samples product pages and its text
checks go to human review, so the recall lost here is recoverable, while a wrong `fail` on a
critical rule is not.

**The general principle.** Where a clause prohibits selling something, the rule's scope is the
selling surface. `scope: "all"` means every URL and should be used only where the clause really
does reach the whole site.

**Accepted cost.** On storefronts whose products sit at root-level permalinks —
corepeptides.com among the five scanned — no URL classifies as a product, and the CATG rules
now return `not_evaluable` rather than matching. That is hard constraint 2 behaving correctly:
the catalogue was not observed, so nothing is claimed about it.

It also makes **Layer 1 shop-structure discovery a priority input for M2**. A rendered homepage
reveals the catalogue structure that a sitemap alone does not, and it is what closes this gap.

## D-012 — Evidence is appropriate to the surface, and the artifact is stored, not hashed
**2026-08-20 · business owner**

Hard constraint 3 required a full-page screenshot and DOM snapshot hash on every non-`pass`
finding. Layer 0 has neither — there is no rendered page at that moment — so the constraint as
written would have made every Layer 0 finding `not_evaluable` and the layer pointless. The
constraint is amended rather than worked around.

**Evidence by kind.** Every finding names its evidence kind explicitly, so the report shows what
was actually captured instead of leaving a reader to assume:

| Kind | Findings | Capture required |
|---|---|---|
| `rendered_page` | L1 and above | full-page screenshot, DOM snapshot hash, source URL, matched value, UTC timestamp |
| `document` | L0 | stored artifact body, its SHA-256, source URL, UTC timestamp, matched pattern, matched URLs |

**Never synthesize a visual capture that did not occur.** A finding may not claim a screenshot
it does not have. Where the capture its kind requires could not be made, the finding is
`not_evaluable`.

### The artifact body is stored, not just its hash

This overrules the earlier instruction to keep a digest alone.

**Reasoning.** A hash proves a document did not change; it does not let anyone read what the
document said. In a dispute, "we hold a SHA-256 of a sitemap we no longer have" is a receipt for
evidence, not evidence. Storing the body makes the exact observation reproducible: this is the
document the merchant's server served, this is the URL in it, this is the pattern that matched.

The SHA-256 is kept alongside the body — that is what proves the stored artifact is the one
fetched.

**Requirements.**

- Store robots.txt and **every sitemap fetched in the run**, including followed index children —
  not only the documents that produced a match. A `pass` needs the same backing as a failure.
- A 200 response that turns out not to be a sitemap is stored too. That document is the evidence
  of why a rule was not evaluable.
- Gzip on write. These are text and compress heavily; the storage cost is negligible.
- Append-only, private bucket, keyed per run. A re-scan never overwrites an earlier run's
  capture (D-002, hard constraint 5).
- A `not_evaluable` finding must evidence *why* it could not be evaluated: the requests
  attempted and what each returned. The peptidesciences.com case is the worked example — store
  the robots.txt body served, the fact that it declared no sitemap, and each of the three
  well-known paths tried with its status.

**Where this is implemented.** `packages/engine/src/findings.ts` defines `EvidenceKind` and
`EvidenceArtifact`; `discover.ts` retains and gzips; `packages/engine/test/evidence.test.ts`
asserts each requirement above, including the peptidesciences shape.
